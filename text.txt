He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight
In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity
The greatest victory is that which requires no battle
Even the finest sword plunged into salt water will eventually rust
There is no instance of a nation benefiting from prolonged warfare
Who wishes to fight must first count the cost
Build your opponent a golden bridge to retreat across
If the mind is willing, the flesh could go on and on without many things
Attack is the secret of defense; defense is the planning of an attack
Great results can be achieved with small forces
Wheels of justice grind slow but grind fine
Who does not know the evils of war cannot appreciate its benefits
Plan for what it is difficult while it is easy, do what is great while it is small
The worst calamities that befall an army arise from hesitation
If there is disturbance in the camp, the general's authority is weak
